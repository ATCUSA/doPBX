# FreePBX in a Digital Ocean Droplet

Watch a video tutorial of how to do this here (coming soon)

This assumes that you choose a CentOS 7 Droplet of any size and that SELinux is disabled (which it is by default in DigitalOcean).

## To get started

1) wget http://www.backusgroup.net/freepbx/install.sh (or the install.sh in this repo)

2) sh install_freepbx.sh

3) Enter in options for MariaDB (no root password)

4) Choose if you want any extra Asterisk Module

Now enjoy your cloud based FreePBX installation!
