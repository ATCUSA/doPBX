# FreePBX in a Digital Ocean Droplet

Watch a video tutorial of how to do this here (coming soon)

This assumes that you choose a CentOS 7 Droplet of any size and that SELinux is disabled (which it is by default in DigitalOcean).

## To get started

1) '''bash wget https://github.com/cameronbackus/doPBX/raw/master/install_freepbx.sh '''

2) '''bash sh install_freepbx.sh '''

3) Enter in options for MariaDB (no root password)

4) Choose if you want any extra Asterisk Module

Now enjoy your cloud based FreePBX installation!
